Left adrift by the recent death of his wife, and hired as Mr. Wednesday's bodyguard, Shadow finds himself in the center of a world that he struggles to understand—a hidden world where magic is real, where the Old Gods fear both irrelevance and the growing power of the New Gods. Mr. Wednesday seeks to build a coalition of Old Gods to defend their existence in this new America, and reclaim some of the influence that they've lost."

            "Drawn from the novel of the same name by Philippa Gregory, and part of The Cousins' War book series, \"The White Princess\" sees England ostensibly united by the marriage of Princess Elizabeth of York (Lizzie) and King Henry VII, but their personal and political rift runs deep and the divide between them threatens to tear the kingdom apart once again. Rumors circulate that Lizzie's long-lost brother Prince Richard is alive and planning to take the throne – forcing Lizzie into an impossible choice between her new Tudor husband and the boy who could be her own blood and the rightful York King. \"The White Princess\" is a tale of power, family, love and betrayal, which charts one of the most tumultuous times in British history uniquely from the point of view of the women waging the ongoing battle for the English throne."
